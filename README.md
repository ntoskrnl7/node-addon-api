# POC implementation of WebIDL Binding Generator.
This repo is based on [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) project. We are following most of things from parent repo. You can see the detailed explainer in https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api/issues/294.

### Getting Start
If you can test this project, you can just do it as follows:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/romandev/node-addon-api
```
and then,
```
$ npm start
```

### Directory Structure
Most of directories are the same with node-addon-api's directories.
Here are only new things:
  - **generator/**: Contains all WebIDL Binding Generator codes
  - **examples/**: Contains a simple example (Calculator)
